A static blog (Jekyll on GitHub Pages) is ideal for medical notes: version control, citations, and simple deploy. No databases, no server management, minimal attack surface.

### What this starter gives you
- Minimal dark theme optimized for reading
- Clean cards on the homepage
- Archive and About pages
- RSS out of the box (via feed.xml)
- Works with pure Markdown posts
